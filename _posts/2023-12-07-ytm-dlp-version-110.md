#### YTM-DLP version 1.1.0 is here!
<!--more-->
This isn't a realy big update, but it is still quite significant.

First, I have updated the package base so that now instead of `ffbinaries-node` module
the app uses my fork [`ffbinaries-node-plus`](https://renomizer.github.io/new-stuff/2023/12/04/ffbinaries-plus-module.html)

Second, the app now officially supports Linux, namely Debian and RHEL based distros.
Can't say about the others, didn't try.

Lastly, now the packager will package not only windows and macos versions, but any, depending
on what platform you use to build the app.

The new version is available [here](https://github.com/RENOMIZER/ytm-dlp-gui/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
