#### Some news
<!--more-->

### New module<br>

I have developed another piece of software that will be used by only three people (me included)!

It is a module that simply gives an easy to use interface to interact with LRCLIB API
and get the lyrics of your favourite songs. Maybe it is a hint to the next update... :)

The module id called `lyrics-snatcher` and you can see it's source code [here](https://github.com/RENOMIZER/lyrics-snatcher)

### License changes<br>

I am probably making too much fuss over this one but I have decided to change license from `UNLICENSED` to `MIT`.

The reason is very simple, at the time I just didn't really care about picking out one that would suit me so just took the most permissive out of all. Now after I have formulated my demands I decided to change it as I should have long time ago.
