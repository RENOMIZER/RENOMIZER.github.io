    The orchestra gives grandeur which battle against the king must have and the break part shows the ennourmous speed of this battle.
    Esspecially good hits the part on <b>3:00</b>. When the leithmotive of the whole layer of Lust starts to play, you finally realise
    who you are battling against - a king who was unrightfuly robbed of everything he and his people have created, a king whose corpse
    is bound to destroy everything he and his people have created, a king finally free and full of determination to take his revenge.`
