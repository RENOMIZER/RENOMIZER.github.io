I'm 17 years old high school student from Russia, 
who's trying to be a software developer.

Primarily I write in JavaScript and Python.

Currently I'm developing an app called [YTM-DLP](https://github.com/RENOMIZER/ytm-dlp-gui),
that allows you to download music off YouTube.

If you want to collaborate with me or give an advice
concerning any of my projects - feel free to contact me
via email or any social in the footer of this page.
