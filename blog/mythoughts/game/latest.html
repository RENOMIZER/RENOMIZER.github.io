    Practicaly no goal, no guidance, the gameplay is tedious, how can you like something like that?<br>
    But after some time you really start to get a hang of it, it really becomes fun to play.
    Running around the whole facility, going one and the same task every day makes you notice some
    things that wouldn't pick your attention if you were busy with story or lore or some high emergency objective.
    The boredom you experience in the beginning drives you to explore and investigate which then
    makes you want to play more, to find more, to understand more. It becomes almost addictive to play.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Voices of the Void</b> is really one of a kind game. I would call it a <b>sandbox immersive sim</b>,
    a type of game where you are given a particular role but how you will act this role is completely
    on you to decide.<br>
    <br>
    It is trully an unforgettable piece of art that I bevieve everyone should touch and experience.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <a href="../../../blog/mythoughts" class="text">&lt;&lt; My previous thoughts</a></div> <h1 class="text underscore svelte-a3aglh" data-svelte-h="svelte-16joifb">_</h1>
