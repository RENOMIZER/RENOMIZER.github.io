It becomes almost addictive to play.\u003Cbr>\n    \u003Cbr>\n    \u003Cb>Voices of the Void\u003C/b> is really one of a kind game. I would call it a \u003Cb>sandbox immersive sim\u003C/b>,\n    a type of game where you are given a particular role but how you will act this role is completely\n    on you to decide.\u003Cbr>\n    \u003Cbr>\n    It is trully an unforgettable piece of art that I bevieve everyone should touch and experience."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
